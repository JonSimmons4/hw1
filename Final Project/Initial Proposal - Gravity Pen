Create a device to simulate gravity in Virtual Reality.

A weighted inner rod moves in and out of a hollow tube, to be held in the hand like a pen.

When a virtual object is picked up, the interior rod moves outward to increase the moment of inertia and create the sensation of a weight hanging off the 
tip of the pen.

When the virtual object is released, the rod retracts into the pen and the weight becomes balanced in the hand, feeling significantly lighter than before.

The weight can potentially be moved and stopped at precise times to jerk the pen, creating a sensation of hitting a virtual “obstruction”. 

A light can be used to simulate a virtual object. When the pen is moved into the field of light, a light sensor will trigger to move the weighted rod outward.
A more complex version would be to connect the pen to a virtual world. This would require a series of highly accurate sensors to detect location of the pen, 
and map it into the virtual world, so it can interact in that space.

Prototype may be made using a printer motor and track to move the weight in and out. The motor will need to be mounted conveniently
and all parts consolidated to the center of gravity to allow for proper user testing. Other materials may include light sensors, distance sensors, 
accelerometers, pressure sensors, and buttons.
